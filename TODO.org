  I guess if we actually get these features built into sykobot, it may actually
  replace supybot as phrik's backend.
** DONE google search
** TODO quotegrabs
   Persistent quotegrabs, including being able to !grab, !rq, and !q <someone>

   ability to define simple persistent factoids that can be called up with just !factname
